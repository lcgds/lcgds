## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>Iâ€™m currently learning <b>Web Development</b> at Senac University. So, feel free to check out my work in progress repositories.</p> 
<p>I love to learn interesting things and play games. Sometimes I can do both at the same time while coding. I guess that's why I like it so much.</p>
